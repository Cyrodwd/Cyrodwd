### Hallo! Ich bin Cyrodwd ü§å

## Status (?)
* Learning **Gentoo**. I practice compiling from the source code of certain tools and programs, such as Raylib. To prepare when installing Gentoo and installing those programs or tools that are not in Portage.<br>

<!-- Personal Information -->
### General information
* I am an introvert, and I get nervous in social situations.
* I explore and use tools, programs or programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not so well known or "unconventional" out of curiosity, such is the case of Dlang and Gentoo.
* I'm not very active in the development space, so I can't always continue projects or things like that.
* My native language is Spanish, but sometimes I speak English but not very well, therefore I have to use translators in some situations. Although not as much as before, I study German.
* Certain times I am silent, I speak little, I participate little or I do not participate at all, but I try when it suits me or when I have courage.
* I don't really like describing myself, I'm ashamed, therefore these characteristics are one of the few that I dare to share.

### Likes
* (**This is more trivial**) I like the color white, something very simple. I also like colors that are easy on the eyes and give "relaxing" vibes; such as purple, black, navy blue, etc.
* I like ***aesthetic*** designs or aspects, but on the one hand it's a "joke" and on the other hand it's serious, because I like things that are pretty or good to look at, but not in such a strict way either. .
* I like FPS and sandbox games, including:
  * Day of Defeat: Source
  * AssaultCube (not so much anymore)
  * Garry's Mod
* I like foxes, wolves, dogs and cats. I don't know, I just like them. üòê
* I like to learn, although not with everything, I like to learn the use of tools, history, geopolitics, programming, UNIX/Linux commands, etc
