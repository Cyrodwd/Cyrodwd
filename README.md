### Hallo! Ich bin Cyrodwd/AuroraPolar ü§å (Sie k√∂nnen mich unter jedem der beiden Benutzernamen anrufen.)

## Status (?)
* Learning **Gentoo**. I practice compiling from the source code of certain tools and programs, such as Raylib. To prepare when installing Gentoo and installing those programs or tools that are not in Portage.<br>

<!-- Personal Information -->
### General information
* I am an introvert, and I get nervous in social situations.
* I explore and use tools, programs or programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not so well known or "unconventional" out of curiosity, such is the case of Dlang and Gentoo.
* I'm not very active in the development space, so I can't always continue projects or things like that.
* My native language is Spanish, but sometimes I speak English but not very well, therefore I have to use translators in some situations. Although not as much as before, I study German.
* Certain times I am silent, I speak little, I participate little or I do not participate at all, but I try when it suits me or when I have courage.
* I don't really like describing myself, I'm ashamed, therefore these characteristics are one of the few that I dare to share.

### Likes
* (**This is more trivial**) I like the color white, something very simple. I also like colors that are easy on the eyes and give "relaxing" vibes; such as purple, black, navy blue, etc.
* I like ***aesthetic*** designs or aspects, but on the one hand it's a "joke" and on the other hand it's serious, because I like things that are pretty or good to look at, but not in such a strict way either. .
* I like FPS and sandbox games, including:
  * Day of Defeat: Source
  * AssaultCube (not so much anymore)
  * Garry's Mod
* I like foxes, wolves, dogs and cats. I don't know, I just like them. üòê
* I like free and open source programs, such as GIMP, Krita, Inkscape, VSCodium, Clementine, etc.
* I like to learn, although not with everything, I like to learn the use of tools, history, geopolitics, programming, UNIX/Linux commands, etc

### Additional description of certain details

* OS: **Gentoo**: Although it is somewhat complicated, I am passionate about it and I like its logo, hehe, something trivial. In addition, I find its Portage package manager flexible and interesting when compiling packages.
* Languages: **D, Lua and C**: C is the best-known language for developing systems, low-level programs, among others. Lua, on the other hand, is known for its clean syntax and in addition to being used for scripting, video game extensions and programs, among other aspects such as video game development with L√ñVE2D. Dlang is less known, but I am interested in its attractive features, and in my opinion its syntax is cleaner and more readable than C++ for example, in addition to having an extensive standard library.

I probably added too many details, but I wanted to share a few additional things.
